# Storage delta calculator

A small tool to compare the actual storage use with the one saved within the state.
Useful as a sanity check if we do any updates (as storage has impact on the amount of tokens that we lock in people's accounts).

TODO(mm-near): Couldn't get this tool to work - maybe the state-viewer behavior changed?
